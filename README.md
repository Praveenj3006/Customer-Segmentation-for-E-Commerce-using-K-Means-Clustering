# Customer-Segmentation-for-E-Commerce-using-K-Means-Clustering
Performed customer segmentation on an e-commerce dataset, which includes information such as age, annual income, and spending score.

# Objective:
The goal of the project is to perform customer segmentation on an e-commerce dataset, which includes information such as age, annual income, and spending score. This type of segmentation helps businesses better understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

# Key Steps Involved:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset (e.g., mall_customers.csv) includes customer details such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.
Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, including univariate analysis to understand distributions and KDE plots to explore income and age distributions across genders.
Clustering with K-Means:

The K-Means algorithm is used for customer segmentation, grouping customers based on their spending behavior and income.
Data visualization techniques like distribution plots and KDE plots are utilized to analyze key features before clustering.
Visualization:

The distribution of features such as annual income and spending score is visualized using seaborn and matplotlib to identify patterns in customer behavior.
KDE plots are employed to observe how income and age distributions vary between male and female customers.
# Technologies:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn/Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
This project demonstrates the application of clustering techniques to segment customers, which is crucial for businesses aiming to personalize marketing efforts and optimize customer satisfaction.
# Conclusion :
This project successfully applied K-Means Clustering to segment e-commerce customers based on purchasing behaviors. The model identified distinct customer groups, enabling targeted marketing and personalized promotions. By leveraging these insights, e-commerce businesses can enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and resource allocation. This project demonstrates how data-driven segmentation can optimize business strategies and improve customer engagement.
